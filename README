The source files have an header that details what the code is trying to address.

* The polymorphism.cpp example demonstrates smart pointres, abstract classes etc
1)  src/C++/polymorphism/polymorphism.cpp

 * The two zoo code examples below meet the following requirement specification:
 * Write a simple Zoo simulator which contains 3 different types of animals:
 *  monkey,
 *  giraffe
 *  elephant
 *
 * The zoo should open with 5 of each type of animal.
 * Each animal has a health value held as a percentage (100% is completely
 * healthy)
 * Every animal starts at 100% health. This value should be a floating point
 * value.
 *
 * The application should act as a simulator, with time passing at the rate of
 * 1 hour with each iteration. Every hour that passes, a random value between 0
 * and 20 is to be generated for each animal. This value should be passed to
 * the appropriate animal, whose health is then reduced by that percentage of
 * their current health.
 *
 * The user must be able to feed the animals in the zoo. When this happens,
 * the zoo should generate three random values between 10 and 25; one for each
 * type of animal. The health of the respective animals is to be increased by
 * the specified percentage of their current health. Health should be capped
 * at 100%.
 *
 * When an Elephant has a health below 70% it cannot walk. If its health does
 * not return above 70% once the subsequent hour has elapsed, it is pronounced
 * dead.
 * When a Monkey has a health below 30%, or a Giraffe below 50%, it is
 * pronounced dead straight away.
 * 
 * The runntime output from the programs can be viewed in the files:
 * C++/zooPolymorphism/zoo.out and C++/zooVisitorPattern/zooVisitor.out
 *

2)  src/C++/zooPolymorphism/zoo.cpp          // Implemented via polymorphism
3)  src/C++/zooVisitorPattern/zooVisitor.cpp // Implemented via visitor pattern

*  The Java version of polymorphism.cpp demonstrates Collections, iterators,
*  exceptions and the Java 8 specific new feature; Streams 
4)  src/Java/Eclipse/polymorphism/src/polymorphismExamples/B.java

    The Python version of polymorphism demonstrates inheritance
